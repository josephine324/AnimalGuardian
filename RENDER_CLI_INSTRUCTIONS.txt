HOW TO USE RENDER CLI TO SEED LIVESTOCK TYPES
=============================================

OPTION 1: Download and Use Render CLI
--------------------------------------
1. Download Render CLI for Windows:
   - Visit: https://github.com/render-oss/render-cli/releases
   - Download: render-windows-amd64.exe
   - Rename it to: render.exe
   - Place it in: C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\ (or any folder in your PATH)

2. Authenticate:
   render login
   (This will open a browser to authorize)

3. List your services to find the service ID:
   render services

4. Run the seed command:
   render shell [SERVICE_ID] "cd backend && python manage.py seed_livestock_types"

   OR use the service name:
   render shell animalguardian-backend "cd backend && python manage.py seed_livestock_types"


OPTION 2: Use Render Web Interface (EASIER)
---------------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your "animalguardian-backend" service
3. Click on "Shell" tab (or "Console" tab)
4. Run this command:
   cd backend && python manage.py seed_livestock_types

This will create all livestock types and breeds in your Render database.


VERIFY IT WORKED
-----------------
After running the command, you should see:
- Summary showing created/skipped livestock types and breeds
- Total Types: 6 (Cattle, Goat, Sheep, Pig, Chicken, Rabbit)
- Total Breeds: 20+ (various breeds for each type)

Then refresh your Flutter app - the livestock types should appear!
